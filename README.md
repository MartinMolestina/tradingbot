# tradingbot
Binance trading bot example
The objective of this exercise is to build a trading bot using the Binance API.

The goal of this exercise is to successfully build a trading bot that interacts with Binance. The trading strategy is not designed to maximize returns.  It is your responsibility to use your own strategy at your own risk.  The purpose of this is not to be a financial tool, but rather a Python programming exercise.
